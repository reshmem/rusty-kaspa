# Legacy Docs (Archive)

This folder contains historical notes, audits, refactor plans, and outdated docs.

- The **current** minimal doc set is in `docs/`.
- Bulk-archived folders from the previous docs tree are under `docs/legacy/archive/`.

Treat everything here as **non-authoritative**. The codebase is the source of truth.
