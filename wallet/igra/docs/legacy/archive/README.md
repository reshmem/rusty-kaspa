# Archived Docs (Bulk)

This directory contains bulk-archived folders from the previous docs tree:

- `docs/legacy/archive/config/`
- `docs/legacy/archive/dev/`
- `docs/legacy/archive/guide/`
- `docs/legacy/archive/ops/`
- `docs/legacy/archive/protocol/`
- `docs/legacy/archive/security/`
- `docs/legacy/archive/wip/`

These files are preserved for history and occasional reference, but they are not maintained.
Prefer the minimal docs in `docs/`.
