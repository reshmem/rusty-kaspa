# Security Assumptions

- Validators for Hyperlane/LayerZero are trusted and their public keys are correct.
- The Kaspa RPC endpoint is trusted and not malicious.
- Each signer machine is secure and private keys are not exfiltrated.
- Iroh relays and peers are untrusted; all P2P messages are authenticated.
- Operators manage RPC tokens securely and rotate them if compromised.
